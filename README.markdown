Career History
--------------

**Senior Developer at Disruptech – Milton Keynes**

_January 2013 – Present_

Disruptech is web startup which is currently producing a new social network website based on Symfony2 using scrum methodology.

Alongside another senior developer, I'm leading development of both front end and back end of the application. As well as evolving and developing the product, I'm providing guidance to 2 junior developers and steering the company towards it's goal of being a cutting-edge software development house in terms of operations, culture and practices.

In addition to the typical LAMP stack, I'm currently working with Symfony2, Doctrine 2 and Neo4j. I've implemented SaltStack, which allows us to automatically configure and remotely manage production and development web servers, making it easier for us to use a service such as Amazon EC2 to quickly provide additional load capacity for an application.

I am also responsible for several dedicated and virtual servers currently across different providers and have overseen the migration from several DNS providers into Amazon Route 53.

**Web Developer at Evolving Media Limited – Bedford**

_December 2010 – January 2013_

Evolving delivers award-winning websites and applications for companies such as J D Wetherspoon, TGI Fridays, YO! Sushi and David Lloyd Leisure.

Development centres around, but is not limited to, the typical LAMP stack to deliver popular websites which generate revenue for Evolving's clients. I've architected, engineered and advised on several systems which include components such as RESTful APIs, message queues and single sign ons.

I oversaw the transition from Subversion to Git version control systems as well as the adoption of a revised development workflow which allows Evolving to meet client requirements of over 20 code deployments per day with full audit trail.

As a firm believer in keeping up to date with the software development industry I encourage and educate other developers within the company. I also enjoy presenting which is a skill that I relish the opportunity to practice and improve upon.

**Technical Director at Guardian Star Limited – Peterborough**

_June 2010 – October 2011_

Guardian Star are a start-up aiming to offer a unique web and mobile based support product for those undertaking activities which put them at risk, such as dating or outdoor pursuits such as hiking, climbing or mountain biking. The service requires users to register their itinerary with the service so that in the event something untoward occurs; Guardian Star has the information at their fingertips to provide to the relevant emergency services. As a key part of the service, it contacts the user to ensure their safety after their event.

As technical director I was responsible for the technical operations, from web application development to the provision of phone systems. 

Technically, the web application was built with PHP5 and uses several external APIs; an SMS gateway for two-way SMS, an Email dispatching service for rejection monitoring, a marketing and newsletter management service and PayPal integration for subscription based payment. It leveraged the Zend Framework and persisted via a primarily MongoDB-based storage.

**Web Developer for i3 Media – Peterborough**

_July 2009 – June 2010_

i3 Media are a digital agency delivering large volume websites and ecommerce solutions to many high profile clients such as Autoglass and The Ideal Home Show, including websites serving over quarter of a million page views a day, shops taking over £100,000 a year and live auction websites. 

Primarily working on an in-house CMS & Ecommerce platform, which was used to deliver standardised solutions, I worked at all levels from database through application to front end with PHP5, Zend Framework, JavaScript and jQuery.

**Software Engineer for Rabbitsoft Limited – Cambridge**

_November 2008 – July 2009 - Red Herring Europe 100 winners in 2009._

Rabbitsoft is a start up business in the process of developing an innovative enterprise business collaboration platform. This extranet application provides collaboration, communication and business applications through a ‘Web Operating System’ interface.

I was one of three developers responsible for the design and development of the application.  I was jointly responsible for the architectural design and development of several modules within the solution including cross-browser rendering of company organisational charts, front end theming and reusable user interface controls such as a custom “select” control which featured images, filter and keyboard navigation.

The front end was completely AJAX driven meaning that the business applications running on the platform are loaded asynchronously and described in XML and JavaScript. The configuration was interpreted by a client-side JavaScript interpreter building the GUI on the fly out of the available controls stack.  The application’s back end was built using PHP5 and MySQL to create a service oriented architecture (SOA) solution which exposed a set of services via a RESTful interface that responded in either XML or JSON.

Following the development of the application I was involved with testing, bug fixing and packaging. This also included working with an early adopter community providing user training and support.

This role was hugely challenging and I gained extensive knowledge and experience of developing a large scale AJAX and LAMP application. 

Following the launch of the product the business focus moved towards sales and marketing and I decided to find a more secure role that would allow me to continue building upon my existing skills.

**Web Developer for Design57 Limited – St Ives, Cambridgeshire**

_February 2007 – November 2008_

Design57 provides web design, software development and hosting services to more than 100 clients.  Their service offerings range from small brochure websites through to fully managed property and product directory applications.

I was the sole technical resource responsible for both the development of new solutions and supporting existing services.  I liaised with the clients and carried out business analysis to determine their requirements to gain agreement on scope and their expectations. Where appropriate I carried out solutions design and planning activities for the project.  

I provided all technical support for live the websites working closely with both clients and third party suppliers. I dealt with fault resolution and managing change requests from clients, ensuring that revenue was generated for the business when appropriate.

The platform was purely LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and covered the full software development life cycle working with both PHP development and front-end technologies such as CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Although challenged to some extent by the existing code base, I implemented reusable and structured object oriented modules that would provide future efficiency savings and improve maintainability.

The responsibilities of this role were very broad and I welcomed the level of autonomy that it provided. It also allowed me to develop my skills beyond just technical development, enabling me to understand the broader business model, delivery through project management, commercial considerations and working closely with clients. 

I thoroughly enjoyed working at Design57 and the opportunity it provided to me, however, as the business developed and the number of clients grew, I felt it was time to move on to a new challenge where I would gain more exposure to application development.

**Self-training and development**

_January 2006 – February 2007_

Having been interested in programming as a hobbyist for several years I was fortunate enough to be able to take some time out during this period to develop my skills and knowledge of software development.  I used this time to gain a deep insight into the LAMP platform and getting to grips with object oriented design and software development best practice. During this time I developed small applications and websites on a voluntary basis to help gain real world experience.
