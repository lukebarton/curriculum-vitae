I am hardworking and tenacious, with an eye for detail and a can do attitude for getting the job done.

**Technical Director at Guardian Star Limited – Peterborough**

_June 2010 – Present_

Guardian Star are a start-up aiming to offer a unique web and mobile based support product for those undertaking activities which put them at risk, such as dating or outdoor pursuits such as hiking, climbing or mountain biking. The service requires users to register their itinerary with us so that in the event something untoward occurs; we have the information at our fingertips to provide to the relevant emergency services. As a key part of our service, it contacts the user to ensure their safety after their event.

As technical director I am responsible for the entire technical implementation, from application development to the provision of phone systems. 

Technically, the application is built with PHP5 and uses several external APIs; an SMS gateway for two-way SMS, an Email dispatching service for rejection monitoring, a marketing and newsletter management service and PayPal for subscription based payment. It leverages the Zend Framework and currently persists in a primarily MongoDB-based storage.

**Software Engineer for Rabbitsoft Limited – Cambridge**

_November 2008 – July 2009 - Red Herring Europe 100 winners in 2009._

Rabbitsoft is a start up business in the process of developing an innovative enterprise business collaboration platform. This extranet application provides collaboration, communication and business applications through a ‘Web Operating System’ interface.

I was one of three developers responsible for the design and development of the application.  I was jointly responsible for the architectural design and development of several modules within the solution including cross-browser rendering of company organisational charts, front end theming and reusable user interface controls such as a custom “select” control which featured images, filter and keyboard navigation.

The front end was completely AJAX driven meaning that the business applications running on the platform are loaded asynchronously and described in XML and JavaScript. The configuration was interpreted by a client-side JavaScript interpreter building the GUI on the fly out of the available controls stack.  The application’s back end was built using PHP5 and MySQL to create a service oriented architecture (SOA) solution which exposed a set of services via a RESTful interface that responded in either XML or JSON.

Following the development of the application I was involved with testing, bug fixing and packaging. This also included working with an early adopter community providing user training and support.

This role was hugely challenging and I gained extensive knowledge and experience of developing a large scale AJAX and LAMP application. 

Following the launch of the product the business focus moved towards sales and marketing and I decided to find a more secure role that would allow me to continue building upon my existing skills.

**Web Developer for Design57 Limited – St Ives, Cambridgeshire**

_February 2007 – November 2008_

Design57 provides web design, software development and hosting services to more than 100 clients.  Their service offerings range from small brochure websites through to fully managed property and product directory applications.

I was the sole technical resource responsible for both the development of new solutions and supporting existing services.  I liaised with the clients and carried out business analysis to determine their requirements to gain agreement on scope and their expectations. Where appropriate I carried out solutions design and planning activities for the project.  

I provided all technical support for live the websites working closely with both clients and third party suppliers. I dealt with fault resolution and managing change requests from clients, ensuring that revenue was generated for the business when appropriate.

The platform was purely LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and covered the full software development life cycle working with both PHP development and front-end technologies such as CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Although challenged to some extent by the existing code base, I implemented reusable and structured object oriented modules that would provide future efficiency savings and improve maintainability.

The responsibilities of this role were very broad and I welcomed the level of autonomy that it provided. It also allowed me to develop my skills beyond just technical development, enabling me to understand the broader business model, delivery through project management, commercial considerations and working closely with clients. 

I thoroughly enjoyed working at Design57 and the opportunity it provided to me, however, as the business developed and the number of clients grew, I felt it was time to move on to a new challenge where I would gain more exposure to application development.

**Self-training and development**

_January 2006 – February 2007_

Having been interested in programming as a hobbyist for several years I was fortunate enough to be able to take some time out during this period to develop my skills and knowledge of software development.  I used this time to gain a deep insight into the LAMP platform and getting to grips with object oriented design and software development best practice. During this time I developed small applications and websites on a voluntary basis to help gain real world experience.
